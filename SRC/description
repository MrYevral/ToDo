Name todo


Example: todo "3 weeks"

data is read from stdin until an EOF (^d) is found.  All the data
is stored in a file whose name is the calculated date for completion
of the task.


Note: todo with no parameters is the same as todo ls


commands added

cat  <number> - print the contents of the task file to stdout
catf <number> - a very crudely formatted task file to stdout
vi   <number> - edit the task file in vi.  (Can also use emacs or other editors.)
ls   <part_date> - This lists out the due date followed by the title line (first line) of the task, for dates matching part_date.
l             - the same as ls
rm   <number> - delete the task file
