Name todo


Example: todo "3 weeks"

data is read from stdin until an EOF (^d) is found.  All the data
is stored in a file whose name is the calculated date for completion
of the task.

One command has been added so far:

Usage:  todo ls

This lists out the due date followed by the title line (first line) of the task.

Note: todo with no parameters is the same as todo ls


commands added

cat <number> - print the contents of the task file to stdout
vi  <number> - edit the task file in vi
rm  <number> - delete the task file
